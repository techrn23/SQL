I created a table for a make up store with 15 items.
CREATE TABLE makeup_store (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, item TEXT, brand TEXT, price INTEGER, quantity INTEGER);
INSERT INTO makeup_store VALUES (1, "Eyeshadow", "KatVonD", 10, 5);
INSERT INTO makeup_store VALUES (2, "Foundation", "FentyBeauty", 30, 6);
INSERT INTO makeup_store VALUES (3, "Blush", "ColorPop", 13, 2);
INSERT INTO makeup_store VALUES (4, "LipGloss", "Tarte", 20, 2);
SELECT * FROM makeup_store

I then wanted to know which items were greater than $10
SELECT * FROM makeup_store
WHERE price > 10;

I then wanted to know the total sales if I got one purchase of each makeup item that day'
SELECT SUM (price) FROM makeup_store;
Next, I wanted to know how many items I have in my store 
SELECT SUM (quantity) FROM makeup_store;
Then I wanted to find out the highest quantity item in the store
SELECT MAX (quantity) FROM makeup_store;
Lastly I wanted to know how many of each item I have
SELECT item, SUM (quantity) FROM makeup_store GROUP BY item;
